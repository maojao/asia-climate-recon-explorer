# Asia Climate Recon Explorer

An interactive web viewer for exploring pollen-based climate reconstructions
from **LegacyClimate 1.0** (Herzschuh et al., 2023, *Earth System Science Data*).

This viewer focuses on **primary reconstruction time series**
(e.g. MAAT, July temperature, annual precipitation) reconstructed using
**WA-PLS** and **MAT**, and is designed for exploratory analysis and comparison.

## Data sources

- **Dataset (PANGAEA)**: LegacyClimate 1.0  
  https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.930512
- **Paper**: Herzschuh et al. (2023), *Earth Syst. Sci. Data*  
  https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2235-2023
- **Reconstruction code**:  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7887565

⚠️ This viewer intentionally visualizes only the primary reconstruction file
(`climate-recons_Asia.tab`). Model statistics and significance-test files are
designed for expert assessment and are not shown by default.

## How to use

- Click map markers to select multiple sites.
- Compare **WA-PLS (solid)** and **MAT (dashed)** reconstructions.
- Use the age slider to focus on specific time windows.
- Export plots and data via **Export ▾** (current view or full series).

Language selection (EN / 한국어) is available in the top menu.
